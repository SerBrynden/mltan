# mltan
Python script to convert between Mean Local Time of Ascending Node (MLTAN) and Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN) of Earth-orbiting spacecraft. This geometric relationship defines the orientation of the spacecraftâ€™s orbital plane with respect to the mean Sun. The MLTAN/RAAN relationship is important for mission design of sun-synchronous, repeating ground track, and other types of mission orbits that must satisfy Sun-orbit plane and other lighting constraints.
